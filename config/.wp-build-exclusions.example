# wp-build-tools ZIP Exclusions Configuration
#
# Copy this file to your project root as .wp-build-exclusions to customize
# which files and directories are excluded from ZIP files during release.
#
# These exclusions are added to the default exclusions list.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# NOTE: This .wp-build-exclusions file itself is automatically excluded
# from ZIP files, so you don't need to add it to the exclusions list.
# The file is read early in the release process to ensure it's available
# when needed, then excluded from the final ZIP distribution.

# Example: Exclude custom development directories
# development
# local-config

# Example: Exclude specific file patterns
# *.dev
# *.local
# temp-*

# Example: Exclude third-party libraries that shouldn't be in releases
# external-libs
# vendor-custom

# Example: Exclude documentation or development files
# docs
# examples
# *.md

# Example: Exclude IDE or editor files
# .idea
# *.sublime-*

# Example: Exclude backup files
# *.bak
# *.backup
# *~
